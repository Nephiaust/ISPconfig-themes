# ISPconfig Themes by Nephi.Au

## Dark Mode v2
This is the currently active developed theme, it replaces the dark-mode theme.

  - Currently it only shows the main menu (once logged in)
  - Search works maybe?

## Dark Mode
This was the first attempt at modifying the existing default theme. Stopped development as its too hard to sort out the broken code between the old bootstrap stuff and the modern version.

## Original
This is a copy of the original ISPConfig theme, copied from 3.2.11
